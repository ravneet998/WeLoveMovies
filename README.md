# WeLoveMovies
You've been hired on as a backend developer for a new startup called WeLoveMovies! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up a database and building out specific routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.
This project is designed to test your ability to both build complex servers and access data through a database. To succeed at this project, you'll need to demonstrate you can do the following:
Install and use common middleware packages. Receive requests through routes. Running tests from the command line. Access relevant information through route and query parameters. Create an error handler for the case where a route does not exist. Build an API following RESTful design principles. Create and customize a knexfile.js file. Create a connection to your database with Knex. Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server. Return joined and nested data with Knex. Write database migrations using Knex's migration tools. Deploy your backend server to a cloud service. It's not necessary to deploy the frontend.
